If both prisoners defect the obtain a lower payoff $P$. However if one prisoner defects and the other cooperates, they receive the highest payoff $T$ and the lowest payoff $S$ respectively. This gives us $T > R > P > S$.\n",

The three strategies explored by Imhof et. al. are always cooperate (ALLC), always defect (ALLD) and tit-for-tat (TFT), where the play cooperates in the first round and then does what the opponent did last round. Classical game theoretic analysis shows that TFT (or a minor variant) is the best strategy.\n",
